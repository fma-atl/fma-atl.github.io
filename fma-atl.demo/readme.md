# FMA-ATL DEMO

This project provides the tool as a library in `src/main/resources/`.

In addition, a number of test cases are provided illustrating the tool API in `src/test/groovy`.

To run them, simply clone this project and run the test cases using `./gradlew test`. The project can be imported into Eclipse using [Buildship Gradle Integration](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration).
